My name is Konrad Hałas, and I am a full-stack developer and IT manager.

Currently, I work at [**FLYR**](https://flyr.com/) as a Senior Manager. I am also a co-founder of [**PyWaw**](https://pywaw.org/), the Warsaw-based Python programmers' meetup. Beyond my professional roles as a developer and manager, I am also a trainer and speaker. While Python is my favorite programming language, I don't limit myself to just one technology.

My passion for programming began in my youth, and I continued to develop it during my computer science studies at the **Warsaw University of Technology**, where I earned my Master's degree.

I'm actively involved in the **open-source** community, contributing to various projects and initiatives. Whether it's writing code, sharing knowledge, or fostering collaboration, I'm dedicated to improving the tech ecosystem.

### Free time

In my free time, I enjoy playing Go (Weiqi, Baduk). I am the chairman of the [**Warsaw Go Club**](https://warszawa.go.art.pl/) and a co-organizer of numerous tournaments and initiatives related to this beautiful game. I also support the Go community with my technical skills — I created a [tournament management tool](https://roundsboard.com/) that is widely used by many Polish clubs.

Beyond that, I love cycling and have a deep interest in Stoic philosophy.
